Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number 3 is odd, 
because it is not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. 
More precisely, if a number 𝑛 can be expressed as 𝑛=2⋅𝑘 for some integer 𝑘, then 𝑛 is even. For example, 6=2⋅3 is even.

Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. 
To see a common example, do an internet search for the query “is zero even or odd?” 
(Don’t search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)

Write a program to help these confused people.

Input
Input begins with an integer 1≤𝑛≤20 on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. 
Each of the following 𝑛 lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer −10≤𝑥≤10.

Output
For each 𝑥, print either ‘𝑥 is odd’ or ‘𝑥 is even’ depending on whether 𝑥 is odd or even.

Sample Input 1	
3
10
9
-5
Sample Output 1
10 is even
9 is odd
-5 is odd
